# Feature
I implemented this repo in March when MixtureofDiffusers first released. Using the examples in the test.ipynb, you can generate images of unlimited pixel size on personal GPU devices like 3060 and 3090. 

With MixtureofDiffusers Controlnet version, you can generate an unlimited size image region by region and can use different condition to control each region. (performing (Multi)Controlnet on each region)
